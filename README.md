🚀 As an experienced engineer and education professional with over 19 years of experience in the industry and beyond, double Master's degree-qualified, and a passion for software engineering, I'm on a mission to develop out-of-this-world projects! I have just finished my training with HyperionDev's Python programming boot camp, and I'm proud to say that I'm maintaining a 100% pass rate. My areas of expertise include Python, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, but I'm always eager to learn new programming languages and technologies for the benefit of organisations.

👨‍🚀 Here are some of my key skills:
*  ★ Leadership
*  ★ First-class MEng and MRes qualified
*  ★ Project management
*  ★ Strong attention to detail
*  ★ Strong problem-solving

🛸 And here's my tech stack:
*  ★ Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, MySQL
*  ★ Technologies: Django, PowerBI, NPL, OOP, Bootstrap
*  ★ Other: Teams, Microsoft Office, Excel, AutoCAD Inventor, Git, Databases

🛰️ Aside from software development, I also love spending time in my workshop, tinkering with various equipment such as lathes, mills, CNC, 3D printers, and micro-controllers. In my mission to spread knowledge throughout the galaxy, I've taught subjects such as computing, engineering maths, CAD, control systems, advanced manufacturing, engineering sustainability, mechanical applications, and engineering design.
