🚀 As an experienced engineer and education professional with over 19 years of experience in the industry and beyond, double Master's degree-qualified, and a passion for software engineering, I'm on a mission to develop out-of-this-world projects! I have just finished my training with HyperionDev's Python programming boot camp, and I'm proud to say that I'm maintaining a 100% pass rate. My areas of expertise include Python, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, but I'm always eager to learn new programming languages and technologies for the benefit of organisations.

👨‍🚀 Here are some of my key skills:
*  ★ Leadership
*  ★ First-class MEng and MRes qualified
*  ★ Project management
*  ★ Strong attention to detail
*  ★ Strong problem-solving

🛸 And here's my tech stack:
*  ★ Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, MySQL
*  ★ Technologies: Django, PowerBI, NPL, OOP, Bootstrap
*  ★ Other: Teams, Microsoft Office, Excel, AutoCAD Inventor, Git, Databases

🛰️ Aside from software development, I also love spending time in my workshop, tinkering with various equipment such as lathes, mills, CNC, 3D printers, and micro-controllers. In my mission to spread knowledge throughout the galaxy, I've taught subjects such as computing, engineering maths, CAD, control systems, advanced manufacturing, engineering sustainability, mechanical applications, and engineering design.

🌙 I'm currently seeking a full-time position where I can develop and share my skills in Python and other programming languages, explore new galaxies and work on exciting projects. If you're interested in joining me on this mission, feel free to contact me at garethreece@hotmail.com. May the coding force be with you! 🚀
