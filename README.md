Currently, I am finalising my training on the HyperionDev's Python programming boot camp, and I'm maintaining a 100% pass rate. My areas of expertise include Python, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, and I'm always eager to learn new programming languages for the benefit of organizations.

Here are some of my key skills:
    Leadership
    First-class MEng and MRes qualified
    Project management
    Strong attention to detail
    Strong problem-solving

And here's my tech stack:
    Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, MySQL
    Technologies: Django, PowerBI, NPL, OOP, Bootstrap
    Other: Teams, Microsoft Office, Excel, AutoCAD Inventor, Git, Databases

Aside from software development, I also enjoy spending time in the workshop helping with various equipment such as lathes, mills, CNC, 3D printers, and micro-controllers and have experience teaching subjects such as computing, engineering maths, CAD, control systems, advanced manufacturing, engineering sustainability, mechanical applications, and engineering design.

I'm currently seeking a full-time position where I can develop and share my skills in Python and other programming languages. If you're interested in working together, feel free to get in touch with me @ garethreece@hotmail.com
